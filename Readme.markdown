Johnny Castaway - This time in boxedwine via emscript

This really illustrates the difference in maturity between the dosbox and winebox projects. 

  1. Dosbox - Emulating dos + win3.1 + johnny - 20% utilization on my i5 laptop
  2. Winebox - Emulating win3.1 + johnny - 26% utilization on my i5 laptop

So, this is noticibly slower than my previous web johnny.

On the other hand, this provides a nice executable base for when/if winebox improves in speed or another wine via javscript is released.
